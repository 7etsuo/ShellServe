Write unit tests for everything.

// this should hold indavidual command lines
// make an array of pipelines for each pipe
// CFG's come in nice here for parsing
struct pipeline 
{

} 

// Each job is a new pipeline stage
CL       -> job[> token] [< token] [&]
job      -> command
PL       -> command "|" PL              // 
command  -> token^+                     // split up by tokens
